Final Approach Plan: CRM CI/CD with Git-Based Versioning
âœ… Phase 1: Build Pipeline (CI) â€” Export & Version
Goal: Automatically export CRM solution and store it in a Git repo with rollback-ready naming.

Actions:

Create a pipeline with parameters:

solutionName, solutionVersion, environment

Export unmanaged solution from source CRM using SourceConnection

Generate a unique .zip file name using timestamp

Clone your Azure DevOps Git repo

Create folder solutions/<solutionName> dynamically

Commit and push the .zip file into that folder

Outcome: Every export is versioned and stored in Git for rollback.

âœ… Phase 2: Release Pipeline (CD) â€” Import with Approval
Goal: Deploy selected .zip version into target CRM with approval gates.

Actions:

Create a release pipeline (YAML or UI-based)

Add a parameter or dropdown to select .zip version

Use TargetConnection to import the solution

Add pre-deployment approval (e.g., your name or team lead)

Optionally add post-deployment validation

Outcome: Controlled, auditable deployment into target CRM.

âœ… Phase 3: Rollback Strategy
Goal: Redeploy any previous version from Git with zero YAML edits.

Actions:

Browse Git repo for older .zip files

Trigger release pipeline manually

Select the desired version

Import into target CRM

Outcome: Instant rollback with full traceability.

âœ… Phase 4: Security & Scalability
Goal: Make your pipeline secure and enterprise-ready.

Actions:

Store secrets in Azure Key Vault

Use variable groups for shared values

Protect Git branches with policies

Add tagging (v1.0, v1.1) for releases

Outcome: Secure, scalable, and compliant pipeline architecture.
